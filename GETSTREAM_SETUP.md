# GetStream Setup Guide

This project now uses GetStream's Video & Audio SDK for live streaming instead of React Native WebRTC.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create GetStream Account
1. Go to [GetStream Dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new **Video & Audio** app (not Chat)

### 2. Get Your Credentials ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Your GetStream credentials are already configured in the Django backend!**

Current configuration in `backend/dareme_project/settings.py`:
```python
# GetStream Configuration
STREAM_API_KEY = '462n3ff7z5ty'
STREAM_API_SECRET = '82p4bnafvf54fc4xm9ac4qdf83wgqdgccsgbayvy58fu3u986hcpyg4fa823nf9x'
STREAM_APP_ID = 'livestream_a6da6b4e-b56c-474b-8d13-bc214cbf33ff'
```

**Note:** Mobile app no longer needs `.env` configuration - all credentials are served by the backend!

### 3. Generate User Tokens ‚úÖ COMPLETED
GetStream requires user tokens for authentication. **This has been implemented in your Django backend!**

The following function has been added to `backend/streams/views.py`:

```python
import jwt
import time
from django.conf import settings

def generate_stream_token(user_id):
    """Generate JWT token for GetStream authentication"""
    if not settings.STREAM_API_SECRET:
        raise ValueError("STREAM_API_SECRET not configured")
    
    payload = {
        'user_id': str(user_id),
        'iat': int(time.time()),
        'exp': int(time.time()) + 3600  # 1 hour expiry
    }
    
    return jwt.encode(
        payload, 
        settings.STREAM_API_SECRET,
        algorithm='HS256'
    )
```

### 4. Backend Settings ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**GetStream credentials are already configured in your Django backend!**

The following settings are active in `backend/dareme_project/settings.py`:
- ‚úÖ `STREAM_API_KEY` - Configured
- ‚úÖ `STREAM_API_SECRET` - Configured  
- ‚úÖ `STREAM_APP_ID` - Configured

### 5. Create Token Endpoint ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**This endpoint has been implemented and is ready to use!**

Added to `backend/streams/views.py` and `backend/streams/urls.py`:

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['POST'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def get_stream_token(request):
    """Generate GetStream token for authenticated user"""
    try:
        token = generate_stream_token(request.user.id)
        return Response({
            'token': token,
            'user_id': str(request.user.id),
            'api_key': settings.STREAM_API_KEY,
            'app_id': settings.STREAM_APP_ID
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return Response({'error': str(e)}, status=500)
```

**Available at:** `POST /api/streams/token/`
**Authentication:** JWT token required

### 6. Update Mobile Client ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**The mobile app has been updated to fetch tokens from the backend endpoint!**

Updated files:
- ‚úÖ `src/store/streamsApi.ts` - Added GetStream token endpoint
- ‚úÖ `src/utils/streamClient.ts` - Now fetches tokens from backend automatically  
- ‚úÖ `app/(stream)/info.tsx` - Removed hardcoded token logic

The mobile app now:
1. **Authenticates with backend** using existing JWT token
2. **Fetches GetStream token** from `/api/streams/token/` endpoint
3. **Automatically initializes** GetStream client with backend-provided credentials
4. **No hardcoded tokens** - everything is secure and dynamic

## üéâ Setup Complete!

All sections are now implemented:
- ‚úÖ GetStream account and credentials configured
- ‚úÖ Backend token generation implemented
- ‚úÖ API endpoint created and functional  
- ‚úÖ Mobile client integrated with backend authentication
- ‚úÖ **NEW: Live stream user invitation system added!**

## üöÄ What's Next?

1. **Test the integration** - Start a stream and verify GetStream works
2. **Test invitation feature** - Invite friends to join your live stream
3. **Add error handling** - Implement retry logic for network issues
4. **Monitor usage** - Track GetStream minutes in dashboard
5. **Scale up** - Add more streaming features as needed

## üì± How It Works

1. **Stream Setup**: When user wants to start streaming, the app initializes GetStream client
2. **Authentication**: App fetches user token from your backend API
3. **Call Creation**: Creates a GetStream call for the live stream
4. **Video Streaming**: Uses GetStream's optimized video infrastructure
5. **Multi-user Support**: Supports multiple participants, screen sharing, etc.
6. **üÜï User Invitations**: Host can invite friends to join the live stream

3. **Monitor usage** - Keep track of your GetStream minutes to avoid overage charges
4. **Implement error handling** - Network issues can affect streaming quality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Configuration is invalid" Error
- **Old issue:** This error no longer occurs since credentials are fetched from backend
- **If you still see it:** Check that your mobile app has the latest code updates
- **Verify:** Backend credentials are properly configured in Django settings

### Token Authentication Fails
- Ensure your Django backend is running and accessible
- Check that you're logged into the mobile app (JWT token required)
- Verify the `/api/streams/token/` endpoint is accessible
- Check backend logs for JWT or GetStream token generation errors

### Video Not Showing / Red Background Instead of Camera
- **Cause:** Stream info screen was missing GetStream camera preview integration
- **Solution:** Added GetStream camera preview as background for stream info modal
- **Fixed in:** `app/(stream)/stream-info.tsx` - Now shows camera preview behind the modal
- **Note:** Camera preview now appears in both setup and info screens

### Video Not Showing (General)
- Check device permissions for camera and microphone
- Test on a real device (camera doesn't work in simulators)
- Verify network connectivity between mobile app and Django backend
- Check that GetStream credentials in Django settings are valid

### "Stream error code 4: JoinCall failed" - Video Resolution Error
- **Cause:** GetStream requires specific video resolution settings format
- **Solution:** Removed custom settings_override to use GetStream defaults
- **If you still see this:** The issue was caused by incorrect settings format, now fixed

### "useThemeContext hook was called outside the ThemeContext Provider" Error  
- **Cause:** GetStream components need proper theme context
- **Solution:** Added StreamVideo provider wrapper around StreamCall components
- **Fixed in:** `app/(stream)/info.tsx` - GetStream components now properly wrapped

### "Method Not Allowed: 405" Error
- **Fixed:** Backend now accepts POST requests to `/api/streams/token/`
- **If you still see this:** Ensure backend is restarted after the fix

### "User token is not set" Error / "Failed to join call" Error
- **Cause:** GetStream client wasn't properly connecting the user with token
- **Solution:** Fixed `createStreamClient` to call `connectUser()` method properly
- **Fixed in:** `src/utils/streamClient.ts` - Now properly connects user with token
- **Note:** Client initialization now uses separate steps: create client, then connect user

### iOS Bundling Syntax Errors
- **Cause:** Corrupted backup files with broken syntax
- **Solution:** Remove any corrupted `.tsx` files from the project
- **Prevention:** Clean up backup files after making changes

### iOS Build Errors - Provisioning Profile / Developer Mode
- **Error:** `Provisioning profile doesn't include the currently selected device` or `Developer Mode disabled`
- **Solutions:**
  1. **Enable Developer Mode on iPhone:**
     - Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Developer Mode ‚Üí ON
     - Restart iPhone when prompted
     - Confirm "Turn On" after restart
  2. **Fix Provisioning Profile Issues:**
     - **Method A - Automatic (Recommended):**
       - Open Xcode ‚Üí Open `/Users/ted/Desktop/dareme-copy/mobile/ios/mobile.xcworkspace`
       - Select your project ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities tab
       - Check "Automatically manage signing"
       - Select your Team (Apple ID account)
       - Xcode will automatically create/update provisioning profiles
     - **Method B - Manual:**
       - Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com)
       - Add your devices under Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles ‚Üí Devices
       - Update your provisioning profile to include your devices
  3. **Alternative - Use Simulator:**
     - Run `npx expo run:ios --simulator` instead

### Quick Fix for Your Current Errors:
```bash
# 1. Open Xcode workspace
open /Users/ted/Desktop/dareme-copy/mobile/ios/mobile.xcworkspace

# 2. In Xcode:
# - Select "mobile" project ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities
# - Enable "Automatically manage signing" 
# - Select your Team/Apple ID
# - Connect both iPhones and they'll be auto-registered
```

### iOS Deployment Target Warnings
- **Warning:** `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set to 9.0, but supported range is 12.0 to 26.0`
- **Solution:** Update minimum iOS version in `app.json` or `expo.json`
- **Note:** This is a warning and won't prevent builds, but should be updated

### "No space left on device" Build Error
- **Error:** `unable to open output file: 'No space left on device'`
- **Cause:** Mac hard drive is full - Xcode needs several GB for build files
- **Solutions:**
  1. **Check disk space:** Click Apple Menu ‚Üí About This Mac ‚Üí Storage
  2. **Clean Xcode cache:**
     ```bash
     # Clear Xcode derived data (safe to delete)
     rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
     
     # Clear iOS simulator data (if using simulators)
     xcrun simctl delete unavailable
     ```
  3. **Free up space:**
     - Empty Trash
     - Delete old downloads, videos, or large files
     - Use Storage Management: Apple Menu ‚Üí About This Mac ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Manage
  4. **Clean build and retry:**
     ```bash
     cd /Users/ted/Desktop/dareme-copy/mobile
     npx expo run:ios --clear-cache --device
     ```

### Django Import Error - "IsAuthenticated is not defined"
- **Error:** `NameError: name 'IsAuthenticated' is not defined`
- **Cause:** Missing import for `IsAuthenticated` permission class in `streams/views.py`
- **Solution:** Add the import at the top of the file:
  ```python
  from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
  ```
- **Fixed in:** `backend/streams/views.py` - Import added
- **Note:** This can happen when adding new API endpoints with authentication

### GetStream Client Error - "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
- **Error:** `‚ùå Failed to create GetStream client: [TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined]`
- **Cause:** User data not loaded from Redux store when stream screens initialize
- **Root Issue:** `useAuthSession` hook wasn't being used in root layout to restore user session from SecureStore
- **Solution:** Updated `app/_layout.tsx` to properly load and wait for user authentication before showing screens
- **Fixed in:** `app/_layout.tsx` - Now uses `useAuthSession` to restore user session on app startup
- **Note:** This ensures `currentUser` is available when live stream screens load

### Camera Not Showing in Live Stream - Black Screen with Controls
- **Issue:** Live stream interface shows controls and LIVE indicator but camera feed is black
- **Cause:** Camera permissions not requested and camera not enabled in GetStream call
- **Solutions Applied:**
  1. **Added Camera Permissions:** Updated `app.json` with camera and microphone permissions for iOS and Android
  2. **Installed expo-camera:** Added `expo-camera` package for permission handling
  3. **Permission Requests:** Added explicit camera and microphone permission requests before stream initialization
  4. **Camera Enabling:** Added `call.camera.enable()` and `call.microphone.enable()` after joining GetStream call
  5. **Front Camera Default:** Configured stream settings to use front-facing camera by default for live streaming
- **Fixed in:** 
  - `app.json` - Added camera/microphone permissions and expo-camera plugin
  - `src/config/stream.ts` - Set `camera_facing: 'front'` and `camera_default_on: true`
  - `app/stream/single.tsx` - Added permission requests and camera enabling
  - `app/stream/multi.tsx` - Added permission requests and camera enabling
- **Note:** App will now request camera and microphone permissions when starting a stream, enable the camera feed, and default to front-facing camera for live streaming
